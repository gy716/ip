### Adding a task
Add a task to the task list of Duke.
> Duke supports for managing three types of class: 
   * Type `todo`: Normal tasks without any dates or times attached to it.
      
      eg.  go to lab for the project.
      
   * Type `deadline`: tasks that need to be done before a specific date/time. 
      eg.  submit essay by 11/10/2019 5pm.
   * Type `event`: tasks that start at a specific time and ends at a specific time.
      eg.  team project meeting on 2/10/2019 2-4pm.    




* **Adding a `todo` task**
    Command format: `todo TASK`
    Examples:
        `todo borrow book`.
        `todo go to theme park`.




* **Adding a `deadline` task**
    Command format: `deadline TASK /by TIME`
    
    > Notes about the TIME format:
    >
    > **The TIME must strictly follow this format: `yyyy-mm-ddThr:mm`**, which indicates
    > that the **month, date, hour, minute must be 2 digit.**
    > Correct format: eg. `2020-09-30T12:18`, `2020-12-03T03:05`
    >
    > Wrong format: eg. `2020-9-30T12:18`, `2020-12-3T3:05`

    Examples: 
        `deadline assignment /by 2020-10-02T23:59`.
